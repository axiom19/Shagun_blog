<h> BLOG WEB-APPLICATION</h>
This code is a Flask web application for a blog website with user authentication, blog post creation and commenting functionalities. The application uses Flask, Bootstrap, CKEditor, SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login and Flask-Gravatar. 

Skills used:
- Python programming
- Flask web development framework
- Bootstrap for front-end design
- CKEditor for rich text editing capabilities
- SQL (SQLAlchemy) for object-relational mapping
- Flask-Login for user authentication
- Flask-Gravatar for user profile images. 

The application has four main routes: `get_all_posts`, `register`, `login`, and `logout`, which allow users to view all blog posts, register an account, log in and log out. Additionally, users can create their own blog posts, add comments to existing posts, and delete their own comments. The code also includes an `admin_only` decorator to restrict certain functionalities to only the administrator account.
